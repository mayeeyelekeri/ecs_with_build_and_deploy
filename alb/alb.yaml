# File: alb.yaml 
# This module creates all the "Load Balancer" related resources 
#
# Before executing this, make sure "init.sh" is called which would create all "Parameter Store" values 
# Also make sure the "network" and "permissions" modules are already created 
# 
# Resource that would be created
# 1) Listener on port 80 
# 2) Target Group based on the application port (mostly 80)  
# 3) Application Load Balancer 

Description: "Create Application Load Balancer"

#  "network" and "permission" modules should have been created already
